Description: Animation of schooling fish in a fishtank. Main is taken
             from psuedocode given in class. Not sure how much grouping
	     is really going on. Fish respond to bounding box appropriately.
	     The line commented out (L98) causes pos/vel of fish to go to nan.
	     Removed the food from sample.in and added warnings to the makef.
